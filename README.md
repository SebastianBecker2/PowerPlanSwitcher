Furher settings allow you to:
- Configure a global hotkey to cycle through your power plans.
- Set your prefered color theme.
- Specify the display of notifications when a power plan is switched by a rule or a hotkey press.
- Define the default power plans to use when your laptop is plugged in or using the battery.
